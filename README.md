dataclip
========

Dataclip allows the results of SQL queries from a database backend to be easily shared. Simply create a query on the Dataclip application, and then share the resulting URL with co-workers, colleagues, or the world. The recipients of a dataclip are able to view the data in their browser or download it in JSON, CSV, XML, or Microsoft Excel formats.
